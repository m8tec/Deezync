## What is deemix?
deemix is a deezer downloader built from the ashes of Deezloader Remix. The base library (or core) can be used as a stand alone CLI app or implemented in an UI using the API.

## Installation
NOTE: If `python3` is "not a recognized command" try using `python` instead.<br>
<br>
### From PyPi
You can install the library by using `pip`:<br>
`python3 -m pip install deemix`<br>
If you install it this way you can use the deemix CLI by using `deemix` directly in your terminal instead of `python3 -m deemix`

### Building from source
After installing Python open a terminal/command prompt and install the dependencies using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user`<br>
Run `python3 -m deemix --help` to see how to use the app in CLI mode.<br>

## What's left to do?
- Write the API Documentation
- Fix whatever is broken
